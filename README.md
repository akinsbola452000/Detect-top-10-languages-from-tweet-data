# Detect-top-10-languages-from-tweet-data

A Python program that reads Twitter tweets from a file in JSON format and then:
â€¢	Tries to detect the language of each tweet by using two different Python libraries: langdetect and langid. Both of these can be installed via Pip. 
	Record the detection results separately for both libraries (for each tweet). 
The language detection concerns the attribute 'text' of the tweets.
Prints out information about the language detection results: how many tweets were detected to correspond to each language (by each library)? 
Note that the tweet data in itself already contains language information (the attribute 'lang') provided by Twitter. A
Prints out for each language (based on the 'lang' attribute provided by Twitter) the list of 10 most common words contained in the tweets.
